1. There are 5280 feet in a mile. Write a JavaScript statement that calculates and prints the number of feet in 13 miles.

2. Write a JavaScript statement that calculates the number of seconds in 7 hours, 21 minutes and 37 seconds.

3. The perimeter of a rectangle is 2w + 2h where w and h are the lengths of its sides. Write a JavaScript statement that calculates and prints the length in inches of the perimeter of a rectangle with sides of length 4 and 7 inches.

4. The area of a rectangle is wh, where w and h are the lengths of its sides. Note that the multiplication operation is not shown explicitly in this formula. This is standard practice in mathematics, but not in programming. Write a JavaScript statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of a rectangle with sides of length 4 and 7 inches

5. The circumference of a circle is 2πr where r is the radius of the circle. Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the circumference in inches of a circle whose radius is 8 inches. Assume that the constant π is 3.14

6. The area of a circle is πr^2 where r is the radius of the circle. (The raised 2 in the formula is an exponent.) Write a JavaScript statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of a circle whose radius is 8 inches. Assume that the constant π = 3.14

7. Given p dollars, the future value of this money when compounded yearly at a rate of r percent interest for years is p(1 + 0.01r)^y. Write a JavaScript statement that calculates and prints the value of 1000 dollars compounded at 7 percent interest for 10 years.

8. Write a single JavaScript statement that combines the three strings "My name is", "Tareq" and "Fadel" into one larger string "My name is Tareq Fadel." and prints the result.
